Matlab scripts for generating thermal models and strength-depth profiles of oceanic transform faults

The scripts Shaka_temp_cross_section_1380.m and Gofar_3seg_C_temp_cross_section_1300.m generate cross sections of 3D fault thermal models. To run the files, place the corresponding text files with temperature, stress, and pressure information for each segment in the same folder.
