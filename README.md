# Oceanic transform fault (OTF) calculations
Matlab scripts for generating thermal models and strength-depth profiles of oceanic transform faults

The scripts Shaka_temp_cross_section_1380.m and Gofar_3seg_C_temp_cross_section_1300.m generate cross sections of 3D fault thermal models. To run the scripts, place the corresponding .txt files with temperature, stress, and pressure information for each fault/ridge segment in the same folder.

The scripts Shaka_strength_depth and Gofar_strength_depth generate strength-depth profiles using experimental flow laws and a modified friction-effective stress relationship. To run the scripts, place the corresponding .mat files with temperature and strain rate information for each fault in the same folder.
